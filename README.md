# Sprint 7 project

Description: this project tests the validity and execution of API tests created on Javascript. These tests covered 4 different HTML requests - GET, POST, PULL, and DELETE. These tests used different endpoints from the Urban Grocers api docs to execute two main tests:
    - Check the response status code
    - Parse the response and check that the response body contains the expected data

Technologies and Techniques: these tests were ran using the following technologies and methods:
- VS CODE 
- Node.js + pacakage manager
- Github

Running Tests:
- find an endpoint to be tested using URL + docs
- create asynchronous code
- run "npx jest" in VS code terminal
