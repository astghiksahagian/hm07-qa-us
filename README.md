# Sprint 7 project

Description: this project tests the validity and execution of API tests created on Javascript. These tests covered 4 different HTML requests - GET, POST, PULL, and DELETE. These tests used different endpoints from the Urban Grocers api docs to execute two main tests:
    - Check the response status code
    - Parse the response and check that the response body contains the expected data

Technologies and Techniques: these tests were ran using the following technologies and methods:
- VS CODE 
- Node.js + node pacakage manager
    - To install Node.js, download the appropriate version for your operating system from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en
    -It is recommended to use Node.js v18. 
    - Once installed, access the npm command-line tool, which you can use to manage packages and dependencies for the project.
    - type "npm init --yes" on terminal to initialize npm.
    - type "npm install jest" on terminal to install jest.
    - When you are ready to start testing using npm, run the following code inside the VS Code terminal: npm init --yes
- Github

Running Tests:
- find an endpoint to be tested using URL + docs
- create asynchronous code
- run "npx jest" in VS code terminal
